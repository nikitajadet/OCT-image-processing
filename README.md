# OCT-image-processing
A set of MATLAB scripts designed to locate the scan at the center of the human retina and extract various parameters from these scans.

Quantitatively, the image containing the foveal centre would have the smallest foveal pit height, or deepest foveal pit (Hell and Weinreb 2019). To take advantage of this and to provide a more objective selection of the image containing the foveal centre, MATLAB code (version 2018a, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) was written to detect the SD-OCT foveal image with the smallest foveal pit height (distance between the foveal pit at the ILM and the photoreceptor layer; Figure 5.3) out of the 256 images obtained in one OCT scan. When running this program, segmentation data are loaded into MATLAB, and for each image contained within the scan, this program isolates 25-pixel windows across the ILM, with each subsequent window shifted by one pixel (i.e. 1st window: pixel 1–pixel 25; 2nd window: pixel 2–pixel 26, 3rd window: pixel 3–pixel 27). A line of best fit (ordinary least squares) was determined for each 25-pixel window, and a line normal to the line of best fit was drawn to the photoreceptor layer (IS/OS segmented layer). This iterative process continued along the entire length of the segmented data. The normal line with the shortest length was then identified as the foveal pit height and was compared with the 255 other images to determine the image with the smallest foveal pit height overall, or deepest foveal pit.
